1. Pick one of the fields in list, then click _Edit_.
2. In the _Configure custom field links_ section, 
   select the target field in the _Linked to_ list.
3. In the _Mapping_ section, each value from the source field can be associated
   to any number of values from the target field.  
   **Note:** Selecting no values means that they are all valid.

### Using LinkedCustomFields

When editing an issue in a project where the linked custom fields are available,
once a value from the source custom field has been selected, only the configured
corresponding values will be available from the target custom field.
